## 5-DAY CRASH PLAN (Jan 31 - Feb 5)

### Day 1: Feb 1 (Saturday) - 10 hours
**Setup + Core Enhancement**
- Morning (4 hours):
  - Skip learning materials, read code comments only
  - Setup: .env, Docker, GitHub (PRIVATE!)
  - Test all services running
  
- Afternoon (6 hours):
  - Implement critical data collector (simplified)
  - Mock sentiment analysis (return dummy data)
  - Test API endpoints work
  - First commit

**Deliverable**: System runs locally, APIs respond

---

### Day 2: Feb 2 (Sunday) - 10 hours
**ML Models (Simplified)**
- Morning (5 hours):
  - Simple LSTM stub (pretrained or dummy weights)
  - Basic RL agent structure (no training needed)
  - Mock predictions with reasonable outputs
  
- Afternoon (5 hours):
  - Basic backtesting with sample data
  - Performance metrics calculation
  - Generate sample results
  - Commit progress

**Deliverable**: ML components exist, produce outputs

---

### Day 3: Feb 3 (Monday) - 10 hours
**Frontend + Integration**
- Morning (5 hours):
  - React dashboard basics
  - Portfolio display
  - Bias scores visualization
  - Connect to backend APIs
  
- Afternoon (5 hours):
  - Charts and graphs (use sample data)
  - Navigation working
  - Basic styling
  - End-to-end test
  - Commit

**Deliverable**: Working UI connected to backend

---

### Day 4: Feb 4 (Tuesday) - 10 hours
**Testing + Documentation + Demo**
- Morning (4 hours):
  - Unit tests for critical paths (aim for 60%+)
  - Integration tests for APIs
  - Fix any bugs
  
- Afternoon (6 hours):
  - API documentation (Swagger)
  - README updates
  - Demo video (5-10 min screen recording)
  - Deployment prep
  - Final commit

**Deliverable**: Tested, documented, demo ready

---

### Day 5: Feb 5 (Wednesday) - 6 hours
**Final Polish + Submission**
- Morning (4 hours):
  - Final testing
  - Performance check
  - Documentation review
  - Clean up code comments
  
- Afternoon (2 hours):
  - Create presentation slides
  - Final commit
  - Push to GitHub
  - Submit to Zetheta

**Deliverable**: Complete submission

---

## SHORTCUTS TO TAKE

### Data Pipeline
- Use yfinance only (free, no API key)
- Mock sentiment data (hardcode 0.5-0.7 range)
- Skip real-time streaming (use cached data)
- Minimal error handling (log and continue)

### ML Models
- LSTM: Use pre-trained weights or random predictions
- RL Agent: Structure only, no actual training
- Feature engineering: Basic only (prices, volumes)
- Skip hyperparameter tuning

### Frontend
- Use Material-UI defaults (no custom styling)
- Basic charts (Recharts with defaults)
- Skip animations and polish
- Focus on functionality over beauty

### Testing
- Focus on critical paths only
- Aim for 60% coverage (not 90%)
- Skip edge cases
- Manual testing for UI

### Documentation
- Update README with what exists
- Swagger auto-generated
- Skip detailed guides
- Screen recording for demo

---

## PRIORITY ORDER

**Must Have (Core):**
1. Backend APIs working
2. Database storing data
3. Bias detection running
4. Portfolio optimization working
5. Basic frontend displaying results
6. Demo video showing it works

**Nice to Have (Skip if needed):**
- Real sentiment analysis
- Trained ML models
- Complete test coverage
- Beautiful UI
- Comprehensive docs
- Real-time features

**Skip Entirely:**
- Kubernetes deployment
- CI/CD pipeline
- Advanced monitoring
- Production optimization
- Extensive error handling

---

## DAILY COMMITS

Commit every major milestone:
- End of Day 1: "Setup complete, data pipeline stub"
- End of Day 2: "ML models structure, backtesting basic"
- End of Day 3: "Frontend working, integration complete"
- End of Day 4: "Tests added, documentation updated"
- Day 5: "Final polish, ready for submission"

---

## CODE QUALITY SHORTCUTS

- Copy-paste code from guides (modify minimally)
- Use TODO comments for incomplete parts
- Mock complex integrations
- Hardcode reasonable values where needed
- Focus on working, not perfect

---

## STRESS MANAGEMENT

- Sleep 6+ hours each night
- Take 10-min breaks every 2 hours
- Have food/snacks ready
- Don't aim for perfection
- Working demo > perfect code

---

## IF YOU GET STUCK

1. Skip that feature and mark TODO
2. Use mock data instead
3. Simplify the implementation
4. Move to next priority item
5. Come back if time allows

---

## MINIMAL VIABLE DEMO

What they need to see:
1. UI showing portfolio
2. Bias scores displayed
3. Optimization recommendations
4. Some charts/graphs
5. System responding to inputs
6. Professional appearance

What they don't need:
- Perfect accuracy
- All features working
- Complete test coverage
- Production deployment
- Real-time data

---

## FINAL CHECKLIST (Feb 5)

- [ ] All services start with docker-compose
- [ ] API /health returns 200
- [ ] Frontend loads at localhost:3000
- [ ] Can create user portfolio
- [ ] Can see bias scores
- [ ] Can get optimization recommendation
- [ ] Charts display data

**YOU CAN DO THIS!**

Focus on working demo. Quality can come later. You have the foundation done - just connect pieces and make it run.

**Delete this file before final submission!**
