## 📚 Your Reading Map

**Starting point**: [00_READ_ME_FIRST.md](00_READ_ME_FIRST.md) (This links to everything)

**Immediate next** (Days 2-3):
1. Read [START_HERE.md](START_HERE.md)
2. Study [DAYS_2-3_LEARNING_GUIDE.md](DAYS_2-3_LEARNING_GUIDE.md)
3. Setup using [DAY_3_SETUP_GUIDE.md](DAY_3_SETUP_GUIDE.md)

**Then implement** (Days 4-15):
- Follow [DAY_4-5_DATA_PIPELINE.md](DAY_4-5_DATA_PIPELINE.md)
- Reference [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) as needed

---

## 🎯 Your Next 3 Days

### Day 2: Learning (6 hours)
- Study 6 behavioral finance modules
- Learn prospect theory, loss aversion, biases
- Review code comments to see how it's all connected
- Complete exercises

### Day 3: Setup (3 hours)
- Configure .env file
- Start Docker services (7 containers)
- Test everything works
- Create PRIVATE GitHub repository (CRITICAL!)
- Make first commit

**Then you're ready for Days 4-15 implementation!**
